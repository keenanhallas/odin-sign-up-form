# odin-sign-up-form

## Sign-up Form Project for The Odin Project Intermediate HTML and CSS Course

### Project Goals

This project will be a chance to review some of the intermediate HTML & CSS concepts that have been covered so far in this section of The Odin Project, as well as a chance to practice setting up an HTML form in a way that is properly structured, accessible, and incorporates a clear and easy user experience. I see the main areas of focus for this project being:

- Continuing to practice all the HTML & CSS skills I have learned so far in creating a page that matches a given design document
- Analyzing the design document in advance to plan out the main scaffolding of the site before any code is written
- Using proper HTML elements and attributes, such as labels and IDs, to make sure that the form is properly structured and accessible to users who are utilizing screen readers
- Trying to consider any best practices in creating forms that I have learned so far in the curriculum, such as when to use certain inputs to create the highest chance of receiving properly formatted data from the user
- Using client side form validation to not only ensure that data is entered correctly in the form, but also that it is clear to users what data must be input, how, and what specifically they need to fix when their data has a mistake
- Continuing to learn how to get around the difficulties of styling HTML forms, including removing default styling, styling based on pseudoclasses & pseudoelements to make the form more clear to use, as well as using classes & advanced CSS selectors to apply styling
- Use of different types of positioning to place elements, such as text related to validation placed relative to its relevant input
- Import a font/fonts through the method shown in the curriculum, using @fontface
- Making the site responsive at different desktop resolutions, including the use of CSS functions to achieve this. Also testing the site in more than one browser
- Consider best CSS practices, such as which sizing units to use or using custom properties
- Dipping my toes into validation using JavaScript

### After-thoughts

I would say that this project was successful at achieving all the above goals. In addition to brushing up on HTML & CSS that I have used for past projects, I was also able to gain some experience with topics that were new in this project. Additionally, there are always lots of small details beneath the big picture concepts that are harder to remember, and only sink in by continuing to work on projects such as this. Some specific things I found myself focusing on were:

- Making the page "immune" to resizing by usings things such as the min & max CSS functions, Flexbox, overflow settings, positioning, and CSS properties such as min-height, min-width, and dynamic units such as vw & vh
- Using a found font by downloading a .ttf file, preparing a font pack form it, adding WOFF/WOFF2 files to the project, and using the @fontface properties
- Proper form structure, accessibility, & usability by using labels matched to IDs, proper input types, aria-text for screen readers, client-side validation, appropriate form styling based on input validity, and dynamically generated content to give the user information about form issues
- Trying out custom form validation using JS, and how best to do this. This was great practice in using query selectors & event listeners. It helped me catch some possible mistakes/errors to watch out for moving forward, which will especially help on future larger projects
- This project was a great exercise in Googling, as I'm at a point where I know enough that I realize something is possible, but often I don't remember how to do it. However, a lot of the time with this project, I knew exactly what to search for to get the answer I needed

### Next steps
Moving forward, there are a few specific things that come to mind from doing this project that I would like to look into, or as least keep in mind:

- In the future, I would like to take advantage of custom properties in order to both make more maintainable code and to avoid having to constantly reference hex or rgb values I've used previously. I think this will also contribute to making sites that have a consistent visual style
- I am happy that I got the JS password validation working, but I have no idea what the best practice for doing this would be. For example, I checked for matching passwords when the form was submitted, but perhaps there's a better time to do this?
- I still need to focus on which CSS units are best to use in which circumstances, as right now I'm just making my best educated guess on what to use. But I'm thinking this will be a thing I just get a feel for over time
- I'm sure that my project isn't as fully accessible as it could be, and I also don't know if I used best practices when it came to accessibility issues that haven't been covered yet in the curriculum. I will be interested in learning more about this moving forward
