# odin-sign-up-form

## Sign-up Form Project for The Odin Project Intermediate HTML and CSS Course

### Project Goals

This project will be a chance to review some of the intermediate HTML & CSS concepts that have been covered so far in this section of The Odin Project, as well as a chance to practice setting up an HTML form in a way that is properly structured, accessible, and incorporates a clear and easy user experience. I see the main areas of focus for this project being:

- Continuing to practice all the HTML & CSS skills I have learned so far in creating a page that matches a given design document
- Analyzing the design document in advance to plan out the main scaffolding of the site before any code is written
- Using proper HTML elements and attributes, such as labels and IDs, to make sure that the form is properly structured and accessible to users who are utilizing screen readers
- Trying to consider any best practices in creating forms that I have learned so far in the curriculum, such as when to use certain inputs to create the highest chance of receiving properly formatted data from the user
- Using client side form validation to not only ensure that data is entered correctly in the form, but also that it is clear to users what data must be input, how, and what specifically they need to fix when their data has a mistake
- Continuing to learn how to get around the difficulties of styling HTML forms, including removing default styling, styling based on pseudoclasses & pseudoelements to make the form more clear to use, as well as using classes & advanced CSS selectors to apply styling
- Use of different types of positioning to place elements, such as text related to validation placed relative to its relevant input
- Import a font/fonts through the method shown in the curriculum, using @fontface
- Making the site responsive at different desktop resolutions, including the use of CSS functions to achieve this. Also testing the site in more than one browser
- Consider best CSS practices, such as which sizing units to use or using custom properties
- Dipping my toes into validation using JavaScript
